# Project_Work

Legacy files relating to my 2022 MPhys final year project. The project used the LAMMPS open source particle dynamics simulator to simulate hypervelocity impacts of silicon structures as a baseline for solar arrays of satellites.


All files relating to my MPhys project aiming to simulate hypervelocity impacts in brittle materials
to relate to spacecraft integrity.

Files located in this repository are a record of the progress of the development of my simulation.
Version numbers with dates are found within the program files as a comment at the top.
